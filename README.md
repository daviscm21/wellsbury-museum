# Wellsbury Museum

# Description

A local museum website including information on the website, a simple donation page and the main feature of the website is four web pages each representing a different part of the museum which allows the user to search for exhibitions by certain criteria. 

# Why I built the website

Part of a larger project to design local business websites for the fictional town of Wellsbury, this was my first website I built which included front end and back end since completing a web design and a full stack developer course on Codecademy and I was looking to demonstrate what I had learnt. 

# What I learnt

As this was my first website I built with both a frontend and backend I developed my understanding of the build process and structure of a website and how each part of the website comes together to transfer the data from the database to what the user sees on the page. For this project I created the webpages before the rest of the website, however I feel that this made me design them in a certain way. I also included a donations page as this is normally something you find on a museum website, however it soon became clear the level of security that was required if personal information was needed and this was not the main aim of the website which was the exhibition section. As I'd already designed the website with the donations page in it I felt that it had to be left in or it would look odd. For future projects I plan to leave the web design until last as I believe this allows for greater flexibility.  

# Future features 

- donations page - add more inputs and therefore more security
- add pages for each exhibition
- allow exhibitions to be searched by date or a page displaying all of the exhibitions on that date
